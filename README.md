# AR Interior Design Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an Augmented Reality (AR) platform for interior designing. The platform allows users to upload photos of their rooms and experiment with different textures and interiors by applying semantic segmentation and texture overlay techniques. This project aims to enhance user interaction and realism in interior visualization, using advanced machine learning algorithms including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Use Case

The platform is intended for interior designers, homeowners, and anyone interested in home decoration, enabling them to visualize changes before actual implementation. This tool helps in making more informed decisions about interior modifications, potentially saving time and resources while achieving optimal design outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Photo Uploads**: Users can upload photos of their rooms to visualize different interior design options.
- **Texture and Interior Interchange**: Through a user-friendly interface, textures and other interior elements can be altered within the uploaded images to preview different aesthetics.
- **Enhanced Realism**: Utilizes semantic segmentation to intelligently identify and modify specific segments of an interior space, such as walls and furniture.
- **Proprietary and ADE20K Dataset Integration**: Incorporates a comprehensive dataset for training the CNN, ensuring robust and accurate segment detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- PixelLib

## How it Works

1. Image Upload: Users upload an image of the room.
2. Segmentation: The uploaded image is processed using a CNN that performs semantic segmentation to identify distinct parts of the room.
3. Texture Application: Users select textures or other interior elements to apply to specific segments of the image.
4. Visualization: The modified image is displayed for user review, allowing for adjustments and refinements

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AR-Interior-Design-Platform.git
